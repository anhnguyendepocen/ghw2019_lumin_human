### Scientific question / value
Use night time lights satellite data to predict rasterized socio-economic indicators with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa region

### Data understanding

The data source for features is sourced from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program - Operational Linescan System (DMSP -OLS) and the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) of NASA/NOAA's Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite, which was launched in October 2011. This dataset is described at https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/viirs-nrt. This sensor is specifically designed for capturing radiance from the Earth at night.

There are both monthly composite images and, more recently, daily images. See https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/viirs-dnb
