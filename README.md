### Scientific objective
The objective is to explore the use of nighttime lights data in conjunction with socio-economic indicators. Nighttime lights data offers an alternative data source to research on socio-economic indicators that has traditionally relied on national census data. There are unsettled questions, new satellites, and novel machine learning approaches that make this an important area of continuing research on a range of questions with significant social and economic implications.## Lumin Human

### Scientific objective
The objective is to explore techniques and tools that utilize night-time lights (NTL) data in conjunction with socio-economic indicators.

### Scientific question
Can NTL satellite data from aid in predict rural poverty indicators in five countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa region?

### Context
Nighttime lights data offers an alternative data source to research on socio-economic indicators that has traditionally relied on national census data. There are unsettled questions, new satellites, and novel machine learning approaches that make this an important area of continuing research on a range of questions with significant social and economic implications. 

### Approach
We approach the project using a recent paper as a framework:
Jean et al, 2016. Combining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty. Science, Vol. 353, Issue 6301, pp. 790-794, DOI: 10.1126/science.aaf7894 

### Data understanding
Two satellite data sources for NTL are used. First, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program - Operational Linescan System (DMSP -OLS) is the established data source for existing NTL data in socio-economic research.  Second, we explore the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) of NASA/NOAA's Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. The VIIRS data offers potentially higher-quality data but requires additional pre-processing steps in comparison to the long-running DMSP data. The VIIRS dataset is described at https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/viirs-nrt. 

The socio-economic indicator data are acquired from the World Bank.


### Data processing

Extracting night-time lights satellite imagery (DMSP and VIIRS) from Google Earth Engine. The script can be found at the following link: https://code.earthengine.google.com/a4343a0c38c2cf49ea2240cd3ffb6971. Replace with your own local drive pathways and file names.
